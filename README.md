#University Data Clustering with K-means
Welcome to the University Data Clustering project! This repository contains an example implementation of K-means clustering applied to a university dataset. The goal of this project is to explore how universities can be grouped based on various features using the K-means algorithm. This project includes code for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

Features
K-means Algorithm: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm to group universities based on selected features.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and transformation to prepare the dataset for clustering.
Data Visualization: Visualizations of the clustered universities using scatter plots and other charts.
Configurable Parameters: Choose the number of clusters and other parameters for the algorithm through command line arguments.
Documentation: In-depth code comments and guides to help you understand the project.

Introduction
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used to group data points into clusters based on their similarities. This project applies K-means to a university dataset to identify groups of universities with similar attributes such as location, student enrollment, graduation rates, and other factors.

Dataset
The provided university dataset (universities.csv) includes various features such as location, student enrollment, graduation rates, and more. The project uses this dataset as an example for clustering. You can use your own dataset by specifying the path to your CSV file in the usage instructions.

Results
The clustering script will generate visualizations of the clustered data, including scatter plots showing the groups of universities based on selected features. The project also outputs a summary of the clustering results.
